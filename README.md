# Fractal Drawing
This repo is a collection of scripts meant to utilize recursion to draw fractals in python. The code is a bit older, so its missing some best practices like function descriptions, but overall everything should work. 

Each script contains everything needed to draw a popular fractal using the __turtle__ package.

## Requirements
